# musicforum
This project is designed to allow users to share their playlists or recommend others specific songs or artists with others. This forum only has four communities (or genres) because they are all the music I like. If you're like me and struggle with finding new music to enjoy, there are people out there to find something new, or something you are already familiar with!
Also, yes, I am aware that you cannot add comments to any forum, I am a college student and have a lot on my plate, but I am hoping to have that and more done before May 5 this year. If you wish to contact me about making more changes to this site, email me at caroline@carolinelove.com (the forms in "help.html" are not real forms and I can't read your inquiries).
