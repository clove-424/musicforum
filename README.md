# musicforum
This project is designed to allow users to share their playlists or recommend others specific songs or artists with others. This forum only has four communities (or genres) because they are all the music I like. If you're like me and struggle with finding new music to enjoy, there are people out there to find something new, or something you are already familiar with!
If you wish to contact me about making more changes to this site, email me at caroline@carolinelove.com.

Detailed updates page and other details can be found in update log.txt
